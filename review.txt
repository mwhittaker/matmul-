What was done well:
Organization and formatting were great. Analysis of different optimization
methods seemed to have been done in an organized and well-thought-out manner.
I liked the detailed explanations of different compiler flags. It looks like
a lot of thought has been put into the different optimizations that have
been tried and have yet to be tried. I like the idea of zero-padding to
mitigate the fact that parts of matrices may not fit into blocks.
Overall, seems like a very thorough and clear report.

What could be improved on:
There were no problems per se with the report. However, as mentioned, you 
should probably experiment more with block size, as our group found that it
can have a non-negligible effect on the speed. Also, keep look into ways to 
combine multiple different optimizations, for it is likely that there is
at least some combination of optimizations that could yield better
speedup than an algorithm using just one of those optimizations.

Other:
It seems like you guys are on the right track. Follow through with the
steps you have discussed in "Future Work" and continue documenting all of
your results in detail, and you should be well on your way to success in
this assignment.
